As it is shown in the folder this is a complete website for school security system built in march 2023 


in this site we have some features to show 
the main feature is the attendance using face recognition and rfid card 
where the student must enter with face recognition so we register his entrence time 
and then when he tries to leave he leave using rfid card after scanning it the time of leaving is registered as well 
also there is amount of ppl who can add or remove students from the data base which can be controlled 
by the administration of the school

the technologies used to achieve this:
python django for the backend 
node js react for the frotend
face recognition library from python libraries
arduino, rfid reader and card 
for the data base i used only mvc the django provides
